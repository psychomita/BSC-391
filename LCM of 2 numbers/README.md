## Problem Statement :
Write a Python program to find the L.C.M of two numbers

## LCM :
LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers is the smallest number which can be divided by both numbers. 

For example, LCM of 15 and 20 is 60, and LCM of 5 and 7 is 35.

An efficient solution is based on the below formula for LCM of two numbers ‘a’ and ‘b’. 

     a x b = LCM (a, b) * GCD (a, b)

     LCM (a, b) = (a x b) / GCD (a, b)
