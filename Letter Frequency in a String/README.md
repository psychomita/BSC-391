## Problem Statement :
Write a Python program to determine how many times a given letter occurs in a string recursively.

## Count occurrence of a given character in a string using simple iteration :
Iterate through the string and during each iteration, check if the current character is equal to the given character c then increments the count variable which stores count of the occurrences of the given character c in the string.
    
    Input : S = “geeksforgeeks” and c = ‘e’
    Output : 4
    Explanation: ‘e’ appears four times in str.

    Input : S = “abccdefgaa” and c = ‘a’
