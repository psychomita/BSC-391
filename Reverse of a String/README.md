## Problem Statement :
Write a Python program to reverse a string.

## Reverse String :
Python string library doesn’t support the in-built “reverse()” as done by other python containers like list, hence knowing other methods to reverse string can prove to be useful.

    Sample String : "1234abcd"

    Expected Output : "dcba4321“

### Reverse a string in Python using a loop :
In this example, we call a function to reverse a string, which iterates to every element and intelligently joins each character in the beginning so as to obtain the reversed string. 

+ Time complexity: O(n) 
+ Auxiliary Space: O(1)
