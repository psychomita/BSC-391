### Examples :
    Input:  a = 1, b = -2, c = 1
    Output:  Roots are real and same 1

    Input  :  a = 1, b = 7, c = 12
    Output:  Roots are real and different
             -3, -4

    Input  :  a = 1, b = 1, c = 1
    Output :  Roots are complex 
              -0.5 + i1.73205, -0.5 â€“ i1.73205
