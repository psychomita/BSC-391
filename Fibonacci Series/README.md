## Problem Statement :
Write a Python program to print the Fibonacci series.

## Fibonacci Series :
The Fibonacci series is the sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers of the sequence. The first two numbers of the Fibonacci series are 0 and 1 and are used to generate the Fibonacci series.

### How to Find the N<sup>th</sup> term of Fibonacci Series?
In mathematical terms, the number at the nth position can be represented by:

F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>

with seed values, F<sub>0</sub> = 0 and F<sub>1</sub> = 1.

For example, Fibonacci series upto 10 terms is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
