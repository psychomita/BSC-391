## Problem Statement :
Write a program to compute a polynomial equation given that the coefficient of the polynomial are stored in the list (import math module)

## Polynomials :
Algebraic expressions with non-negative power are called polynomials. Polynomials are the addition of monomials, binomials, and others. For example, f(x) = 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 5 is a polynomial with a degree of 2. The polynomial formula has both like terms and unlike terms.

+ Like terms have the same powers of the same variable.
+ Unlike terms have different variables and different powers.

### Polynomial Formula
ax<sup>n</sup> + bx<sup>n-1</sup> + cx<sup>n-2</sup> +…+ px + q

where,
a, b, c, …, p and q are coefficients,
x is the variable,
n is the degree of the polynomial.
