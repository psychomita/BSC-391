## Problem Statement :
A study was performed on a wear of bearing Y and its relationship to x<sub>1</sub>= oil viscosity and x<sub>2</sub>= load.
The following data were obtained. Fit a multiple linear regression model.

| Y | x<sub>1</sub> | x<sub>2</sub> |
| - | ------------- | ------------- |
| 293 | 1.6  | 851 |
| 230 | 15.5 | 816 |
| 172 | 22.0  | 1058 |
| 91  | 43.0  | 1201 |
| 113 | 33.0  | 1357 |
| 125 | 40.0 | 1115 |

## Multiple Linear Regression Model :

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict
the outcome of a response variable. It is used to estimate the relationship between two or more independent
variables and one dependent variable. It allows us to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the
independent variable(s) change. MLR is used extensively in econometrics and financial inference.
