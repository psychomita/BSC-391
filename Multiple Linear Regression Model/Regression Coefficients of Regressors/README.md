## Problem Statement :
    Use Python and its libraries to find regression coefficients of regressors of the given data.
In statistics and econometrics, the regression coefficient of a regressor (also known as an independent variable or predictor variable) represents the relationship between that specific regressor and the dependent variable in a regression model. It quantifies the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the regressor, while holding all other regressors constant.
In a simple linear regression model, where you have one dependent variable (Y) and one independent variable (X), the regression coefficient is typically denoted as "β" and is estimated using the least squares method. The regression equation takes the form:

Y = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>x + ε

where:

Y is the dependent variable.

X is the independent variable.

β<sub>0</sub> is the intercept (the value of Y when X is 0).

β<sub>1</sub> is the regression coefficient of the independent variable X.

ε represents the error term (the part of Y that the model cannot explain).

The coefficient β<sub>1</sub> measures the change in Y for a one-unit change in X. If β<sub>1</sub> is positive, it indicates a positive relationship between X and Y, meaning that as X increases, Y tends to increase. If β<sub>1</sub> is negative, it indicates a negative relationship, suggesting that as X increases, Y tends to decrease.

In multiple regression, where there are multiple independent variables, each independent variable will have its own regression coefficient, and these coefficients measure the impact of each variable while controlling for the others.
